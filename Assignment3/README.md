# Async Callback Refactor

This project demonstrates how to convert Node.js callback-based asynchronous code into modern Promise-based and Async/Await syntax.

## Structure

- `callback-style`: Traditional callback usage.
- `promise-style`: Promise-based refactor.
- `async-await-style`: Final version using async/await.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run callback
npm run promise
npm run async
```
